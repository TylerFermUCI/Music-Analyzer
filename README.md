Valence: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).

Arousal was defined as emotionally stimulating or active, and valence was explained as being positive or negative with the examples of ‘happy’ and ‘sad’ provided as illustrations.
